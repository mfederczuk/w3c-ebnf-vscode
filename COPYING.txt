All files should contain a SPDX short-form identifier to declare under which license they are published.
A SPDX short-form identifier takes the form of:

        SPDX-License-Identifier: <SPDX License Expression>

Read more about SPDX short-form identifiers here: <https://spdx.dev/ids/>


Files where a SPDX short-form identifier cannot be used or does not fit (for whatever reason) are listed here.
The left hand side of the colon (':') is the path of the file or directory, and the right hand side of the colon is the
SPDX license expression that the path is licensed under.
If the path is a directory, then all files inside the directory are licensed under the expression recursively.

        .github/issue_labels.json: CC0-1.0
        .github/pull_request_template.md: CC0-1.0

The SPDX short-form identifier inside distinct files have higher precedence than this list and will override the license
expression when they differ.


The individual licenses, used in this repository, can be found in the 'LICENSES' directory and are also listed here:
